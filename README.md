# Task-Board

## Description

```md
In this challenge, in addition to consolidating the knowledge to develop dynamic web pages,
the use of API libraries (that in theory facilitate JS programming) was put into practice.
Given the speed of the bootcamp it is difficult to achieve mastery of the new libraries but
what is motivating is to identify the potential they have to facilitate the work.

I developed this project to:
    - To have a better knowledge in the development of dynamic pages
    - Continue practicing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
    - Continue nderstanding the use of the DOM (document object model).
    - Continue handling of the browser's temporary memory (localStorage).
    - Recognizing the potential of APIs in development


The challenge is to build a task board with the drag and drop functionality

During the development of the project, several things were clarified:
    - This challenge was a great debugging practice.
    - The highly relevant use of the console.log to follow the flow program
    - The highly relevant use of the dev tools CONSOLE for debugging the project
    - The value of the dev tools ELEMENTS option to identify how the elements were being created in html

During this project I learned:
    - How link the libraries.
    - The potencial of bootstrap for page style.
    - Be more careful in writing the code to avoid bugs. 
 
```
